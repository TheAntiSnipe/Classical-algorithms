    "### Huffman Coding Problem\n",
    "\n",
    "Since we're on the topic of graphs, let's consider another classical graph greedy problem. This is a data compression problem called the Huffman coding problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "The idea behind Huffman coding is this:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. You have a limited \"alphabet\" of symbols that will be sent over a certain channel in binary.\n",
    "2. You want to make it so that this alphabet is unique.\n",
    "3. You want to make it so that it is minimal.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "As an example, let's say you have an alphabet of length 3. Three letters, a, b and c.\n",
    "What's wrong with this mapping? a:00 b:0 c:10\n",
    "Well, consider the message 000. Is it ab? Or ba?\n",
    "```\n",
    "This sort of ambiguity is not allowed in a correct solution. There should be only **one** valid cut.\n",
    "\n",
    "At the same time, depending on the messages you're sending, you're gonna want this code to be minimal. **Common letters should thus occupy less space.**\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Okay, then, we've established the nature of the problem. We want to make a **language** that is **non-ambiguous** and **minimal**.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Let's go about fixing the easier part of the problem; How do you make a language minimal?*\n",
    "\n",
    "**Well, you make the most common case minimal!** As we mentioned three points ago, common letters should occupy less space!\n",
    "\n",
    "So given a frequency table of how many letters on an average of each type cross the channel per unit time, we can figure out the most minimal encoding!\n",
    "\n",

This letter has no children, because having children in this sequence means that children will necessarily be non-unique. Assume b was a's child on the '1' side.

    "### Interval scheduling problem\n",
    "\n",
    "We did a few graph problems here, but let's go back to one of the more basic applications of the greedy paradigm: Job scheduling algorithms. Specifically, the interval scheduling problem is quite a topic of interest when it comes to this. In its default state, it is a greedy problem. However, it becomes a dynamic programming problem when we add more variables into the mix.\n",
    "\n",
    "Alright, for now though, we're dealing with the base form of the problem. What do you have?\n",
    "```\n",
    "You've got jobs that you need to schedule. \n",
    "Each job has a certain start time and a certain end time.\n",
    "The idea is that you want to fit in jobs such that you get\n",
    "the most *number* of jobs filling up the timescale.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, have an image!\n",
    "\n",
    "![An example of a job scheduling problem input](sch1.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Alright, let's get to attacking this problem. Greedy problem approaches dictate:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Make a decision\n",
    "2. Prove that the decision is correct\n",
    "3. Prove that the decision reduces the problem to a smaller version of the original problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "How do you make that work here?\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's run through some candidate decisions!\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Choose the shortest jobs until you no longer can!\n",
    "![Not really what we hoped for!](sch2.png)\n",
    "Choosing the shortest jobs seems to work, however, let us consider a testcase here:\n",
    "![oops](sch2-edge.png)\n",
    "Due to conflicts, we run into an issue where the shortest job selection blocks the actual optimal case from being considered. It is easy to see that choosing the largest job will also lead to similar problems and would, in fact, also work against our interests.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Choose the jobs that conflict with the least number of other jobs first!\n",
    "![Nope](sch4.png)\n",
    "Seeing as conflicts are what caused the problem, let's try to avoid conflict as much as we can. However, as we've studied in greedy problems before, doing this does not necessarily help optimize the problem. Here's an example where the anti-conflict algorithm fails:\n",
    "![oof](sch4-edge.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's try to manually look at optimal solutions! After going through some candidates, we see that there's an interesting one here:\n",
    "\n",
    "![Okay, what's this?](sch5.jpeg)\n",
    "This is cool and all, but why does it work? What did we do that makes this choice of jobs good?\n",
    "\n",
    "Well, we're working our way down the timescale, starting at t=0, and looking at which job finishes the quickest from there. Why, then, does this strategy work?\n",
    "\n",
    "##### We need to go a bit deeper!\n",
    "\n",
    "What was the objective again? We wanted to schedule as many jobs as possible. The selection of the quickest terminating job, allows us to choose the next job in the **most flexible manner**. The exact same strategy will work in reverse. You can also choose the job that, out of the rest of them, has the **latest start time**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Alright! We've established that:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The solution we came up with makes a smart choice (taking the job with the earliest end time to get optimum flexibility when going through the timescale).\n",
    "2. The solution's smart choice is indeed smart. (by intuition, can use an exchange lemma if necessary, but this is not a theoretical algorithms class)\n",
    "\n",
    "What about #3? Does this solution reduce the size of the existing problem? Well, yes! Let's run through the process of getting the image we saw last!\n",
    "\n",
    "![That's it](schfin.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Clearly, as we eliminate (in yellow) stuff that cannot be scheduled, we turn the current problem into a smaller instance of the initial problem."
