    "### Huffman Coding Problem\n",
    "\n",
    "Since we're on the topic of graphs, let's consider another classical graph greedy problem. This is a data compression problem called the Huffman coding problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "The idea behind Huffman coding is this:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. You have a limited \"alphabet\" of symbols that will be sent over a certain channel in binary.\n",
    "2. You want to make it so that this alphabet is unique.\n",
    "3. You want to make it so that it is minimal.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "As an example, let's say you have an alphabet of length 3. Three letters, a, b and c.\n",
    "What's wrong with this mapping? a:00 b:0 c:10\n",
    "Well, consider the message 000. Is it ab? Or ba?\n",
    "```\n",
    "This sort of ambiguity is not allowed in a correct solution. There should be only **one** valid cut.\n",
    "\n",
    "At the same time, depending on the messages you're sending, you're gonna want this code to be minimal. **Common letters should thus occupy less space.**\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Okay, then, we've established the nature of the problem. We want to make a **language** that is **non-ambiguous** and **minimal**.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Let's go about fixing the easier part of the problem; How do you make a language minimal?*\n",
    "\n",
    "**Well, you make the most common case minimal!** As we mentioned three points ago, common letters should occupy less space!\n",
    "\n",
    "So given a frequency table of how many letters on an average of each type cross the channel per unit time, we can figure out the most minimal encoding!\n",
    "\n",
    "*What about non-ambiguous nature? Well, that's a tougher problem.*"

    "\n",
    "But how?\n",
    "\n",
    "Well, this is binary, and you're dealing with a sequence that needs to be interpreted a certain way. In a way, you're trying to make **decisions** about **how long (deep) a word must go in binary form.**\n",

This letter has no children, because having children in this sequence means that children will necessarily be non-unique. Assume b was a's child on the '1' side. You would then have an ambiguity if you had 11, because you'd be unable to tell if this was 'aa' or 'b'. This is **a necessity for the non-ambiguity constraint.**\n",

    "\n",
    "- Well, clearly, b and c had the lowest frequencies, so it made sense to make them the two siblings at the very bottom of the tree.\n",
    "- After that, you had the following alphabet if you considered (b+c) to be a \"letter\" with a frequency of (3+4=)7.\n",
